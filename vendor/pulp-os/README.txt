x4-os -- e-reader firmware for the XTEink X4

bare-metal e-reader operating system for the XTEink X4 board
(ESP32-C3 + SSD1677 e-paper). written in Rust. no std, no
framebuffer, no dyn dispatch. async runtime via Embassy on
esp-rtos. Forked from pulp-os

hardware
    mcu         ESP32-C3, single-core RISC-V RV32IMC, 160 MHz
    ram         400 KB DRAM; ~172 KB heap (108 KB main + 64 KB reclaimed)
    display     800x480 SSD1677 mono e-paper, DMA-backed SPI, portrait
    storage     microSD over shared SPI bus (400 kHz probe, 20 MHz run)
    input       2 ADC ladders (GPIO1, GPIO2) + power button (GPIO3 IRQ)
    battery     li-ion via ADC, 100K/100K divider on GPIO0

    pin map:
      GPIO0   battery ADC          GPIO6   EPD BUSY
      GPIO1   button row 1 ADC     GPIO7   SPI MISO
      GPIO2   button row 2 ADC     GPIO8   SPI SCK
      GPIO3   power button         GPIO10  SPI MOSI
      GPIO4   EPD DC               GPIO12  SD CS (raw register GPIO)
      GPIO5   EPD RST              GPIO21  EPD CS

    EPD and SD share SPI2, arbitrated by CriticalSectionDevice.

building
    requires stable Rust >= 1.88 and the riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf
    target. rust-toolchain.toml handles both automatically.

        cargo build --release
        espflash flash --monitor --chip esp32c3 target/...

        cargo run --release

runtime
    embassy async executor on esp-rtos. five concurrent tasks:

    main            event loop: input dispatch, app work, rendering
    input_task      10 ms ADC poll, debounce, battery read (30 s)
    housekeeping    status bar (5 s), SD check (30 s), bookmark flush (30 s)
    idle_timeout    configurable idle timer, signals deep sleep
    worker_task     background CPU-heavy work (HTML strip, image decode)

    CPU sleeps (WFI) whenever all tasks are waiting.

design notes
    kernel / app split. the kernel crate (kernel/) has zero imports
    from apps/ or fonts/. the scheduler is generic over AppLayer;
    it never names a concrete app. AppId is defined by the distro,
    not the kernel -- the kernel only knows AppIdType::HOME.

    no dyn dispatch. with_app!() macro matches AppId, expands to
    concrete calls per app struct. all monomorphised; no vtable,
    no Box.

    strip rendering. 12 x 40-row strips (4 KB each) instead of a
    48 KB framebuffer. draw callback fires per strip during SPI
    transfer. blit_1bpp_270 fast path walks physical memory linearly
    for the portrait rotation. windowed mode for partial refresh.

    3-phase partial refresh. write BW RAM, kick DU waveform, collect
    input during ~400 ms refresh, then sync RED RAM. phase3 skipped
    during rapid navigation (RED marked stale; next partial uses
    inv_red recovery). full GC promoted after configurable number
    of partials to clear ghosting.

    SPI bus sharing. EPD and SD share one SPI2 bus. all SD I/O
    completes before any EPD render pass. busy_wait_with_input()
    collects only input events, no background work. violating the
    ordering panics (RefCell double-borrow), never corrupts.

    poll_once. embedded-sdmmc's async API wraps blocking SPI+DMA
    that never pends. poll_once drives every future to completion
    in a single poll, avoiding task spawn overhead.

    KernelHandle. apps never touch hardware. KernelHandle borrows
    the Kernel for one lifecycle method and exposes file I/O, dir
    cache, bookmarks. every async method does sync work then
    yield_now() for executor fairness.

    smol-epub sync bridge. smol-epub I/O uses closures, not async.
    with_sync_reader() provides a scoped closure that completes
    all storage access before returning -- no borrows across await.

    heavy statics. large structs (ReaderApp ~28 KB, DirCache ~10 KB,
    StripBuffer ~4 KB) live in ConstStaticCell / StaticCell so the
    async future stays ~200 B.

    nav stack. Launcher<Id> holds a 4-deep stack. transitions
    (Push/Pop/Replace/Home) drive on_suspend / on_enter / on_resume
    lifecycle. Push degrades to Replace when stack is full.

    dirty-region tracking. apps call ctx.mark_dirty(region); regions
    are unioned per frame. partial DU or full GC issued accordingly.

    work queue. dedicated embassy task for CPU-heavy work (HTML strip,
    image decode). generation-based cancellation: bump a counter and
    drain channels; worker checks generation before and after
    processing. channel capacity 1 for back-pressure.

    input. ADC ladders at 100 Hz, 4-sample oversampling, 15 ms
    debounce, 1 s long-press, 150 ms repeat. ButtonMapper translates
    physical buttons to semantic actions. apps never see hardware.

    fonts. build.rs rasterises TTFs via fontdue into 1-bit bitmaps
    at five sizes (xsmall through xlarge), three styles (regular,
    bold, italic). ASCII direct-indexed, extended unicode binary-
    searched. book and UI sizes independently hot-swappable.

    boot console. kernel renders text during hardware init using
    built-in FONT_6X13 mono font. works with zero fontdue, zero
    TTFs. if the SD card is missing, user still sees boot progress.

    bookmarks. 16-slot LRU, RAM-resident, binary format on SD.
    flushed every 30 s if dirty, plus on sleep. lookup by fnv1a
    hash + case-insensitive name comparison.

    settings. key=value text in _x4/SETTINGS.TXT. parsed at boot,
    saved on change. font size changes propagate to all apps.

    wifi upload. bypasses normal dispatch. HTTP server on port 80,
    mDNS on 5353 (x4.local). multipart upload with 8.3 filename
    sanitisation. radio torn down before returning to app loop.

    memory budget. ~172 KB heap for epub text and image decode
    (alloc::vec). everything else is static or stack. ~56 KB stack,
    painted 0xDEAD_BEEF at boot, high-water mark logged every 5 s.

    forkable kernel. designed to be extracted as a standalone crate.
    a fork defines its own AppId, implements AppLayer, brings its
    own fonts and apps, writes a main.rs. the kernel provides
    drivers, scheduling, storage, bookmarks, config, and a working
    EPD with mono boot console.
